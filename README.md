## Introduction
The primary goal of this project was to self teach TypeScript. We decided to create an application where a user can view weather in any city they wish. A user can then click on a city card on the home page to view a more in depth forecast for that city. The specifications for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/stretch.html)

## Goals
* Self teach TypeScript
* Use OpenWeather API to recieve weather for current cities
* Use TDD - Cypress 
* Create a search bar with Google places suggestions
* Easy to navigate UI/UX
